           <p>Matrix is an open standard for interoperable, decentralised, real-time communication over IP.</p>
           <ol>
               <li>there exists an <strong>open standard</strong> in the form of the <a href="https://matrix.org/docs/spec/">Matrix Specification</a></li>
               <li>it's <strong>interoperable</strong>, meaning it is designed to <i>interoperate</i> with other communication systems, and being an Open Standard means it's easy to see how to interoperate with it</li>
               <li>Matrix is <strong>decentralised</strong>, which means there is <i>no central point</i> - anyone can host their own server and have control over their data</li>
               <li>it is designed to function in <strong>real-time</strong>, which means it is ideal for building systems that require immediate exchange of data, such as Instant Messaging</li>
           </ol>
           <p>You can make bots using js to interact with Matrix. Here's how to begin setting up your build environment to create your bot:</p>
           <code>
            mkdir my-bot<br>
            cd my-bot<br>
            npm install matrix-js-sdk<br>
            touch index.js<br>
            </code>

            <header id="mod">Moderation in Matrix</header>
            <p>Matrix is an open protocol and network for decentralised communication, where users can participate in public and private chat rooms through servers (‘homeservers’) and clients of their choice, similar to email. The goal is to provide a free and open global network for interoperable e2e-encrypted communication, without sacrificing usability, and so liberate users from being trapped in the proprietary communication silos which have become commonplace today.
                <br><br> A large open communication network (much like email or the web itself) comes with an interesting set of challenges around moderation. For Matrix, this boils down to:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>ensuring that moderators of chatrooms have the necessary tools to enforce whatever code of conduct they require</li>
                <li>ensuring that server administrators can enforce terms of service on how their servers are used</li>
                <li>ensuring that users themselves are empowered to filter out content they do not wish to see.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>In Matrix, one tool that moderators have is kicking people from servers. This can be done via the Kick or Ban buttons from the user info panel, or by typing <code>/kick @user:domain.com <reason goes here></code> or <code>/ban @user:domain.com <reason goes here></code> in the message composer.</p>

            <header id="encryption">End-to-End Encryption in Matrix</header>
            <p>End-to-end encryption in Matrix is based on the Olm and Megolm cryptographic ratchets. The recommended starting point for any client authors is with the <a href="https://matrix.org/git/olm">libolm</a> library, which contains implementations of all of the cryptographic primitives required. The library itself is written in C/C++, but is architected in a way which makes it easy to write wrappers for higher-level languages.</p>
            <p>To enable encryption in a room, a client should send a state event of type <code>m.room.encryption_,</code> and <code>content { "algorithm": "m.megolm.v1.aes-sha2" }</code>.</p>

            <header id="bridge">Bridging Matrix With Other Services</header>
            <p>Bridges come in many flavours, and we need consistent terminology within the Matrix community to ensure everyone (users, developers, core team) is on the same page. This post is primarily intended for bridge developers to refer to when building bridges.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>portal rooms</li>
                <li>plumbed rooms</li>
            </ol>
            <p>One-way bridging is rare, but can be used to represent a bridge that is bridging from the remote system into matrix. This is common when the remote system does not permit message posting, or is simply not capable of handling posting outside their system. The users bridged from the remote system often appear as virtual users in matrix, as is the case with <a href="https://github.com/turt2live/matrix-appservice-instagram">matrix-appservice-instagram</a>.</p>
