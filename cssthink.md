### what is this website going to look like? 
### what should each part of this website do?

# here's the story: 

When I arrive to Matrix Docs, I notice that the page is divided into two unequal columns, with the bigger one on the right, filling approx 2/3 of the viewport. 

I don't notice the font very much, and am drawn to the title in the top left corner, and see that there are what appear to be section titles decending below the title. 

When I hover my mouse over the section titles in the left hand column I can see that they are linked to headers in the main body of the site. 

The main body of the site is one long document that I can scroll through. There are clear headings, paragraphs, links, some code, and some lists. 

As I begin to click the navigation headings on the right, I am taken to the relevant heading in the document. The heading in the document snaps to the top of the viewport when I click the nav link. 

As I am reading through each section, I notice that the code blocks are very easy to read because they typically take up their own lines and have a background box that they are sitting in that separates them from the other content.         

I notice that if I resize the veiwport down to less than half my screen size, the navigation section relocates to the top of my screen, stacking on top of the main body, and becoming a scrollable section that occupies approx. 25% of the viewport.
